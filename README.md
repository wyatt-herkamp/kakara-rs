## Why is it named Kakara-rs?

Me and a friend wrote a Minecraft clone named [Kakara](https://github.com/kakaragame/Kakara) in Java once. The project was abandoned and I thought it would be funny to name my experiment Kakara-rs.

## WHY NIGHTLY????

Because this is not a serious project I might want to use nightly features.
